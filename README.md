* Swap WCF REST Starter Kit Preview 2 for http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Net.Http
* Create Task based version
* Make it easy to inject error extraction but default to web api model state errors
* Add Json.Net as a Formatters option and make the formatters configurable similar to Web Api Formatters 
* Add OAuth support
* Inspired by SimipleData - use of DynamicObject to generate resources by convention
